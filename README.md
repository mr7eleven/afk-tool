AFK-Tool

a simple Python3 script by Devin Foust
 
 
 
Easy to understand and tweak!
A simple script to move your mouse and/or click at specified intervals. 

The script asks you to input your resolution, then asks you how long to wait before running the script, how long to run the script, the amount of time to wait between movements, and finally, whether or not you'd like the mouse to be clicked after each movement.

The script waits for the amount of time specified, and then runs the script, moving to random coordinates on your screen in the user-specified intervals, and clicks (if you so choose).



Features coming:
- ability to detect your resolution automatically
- ability to choose between mouse clicks (left / right / middle)
- a GUI! :)
